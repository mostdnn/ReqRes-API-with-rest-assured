Selenium Test Automation Framework
Overview
This is a Selenium Test Automation Framework designed to automate web application testing using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, TestNG for test management, Allure Report for test reporting, and Data-Driven Testing for parameterized test cases. The framework is compatible with IntelliJ IDEA as the primary IDE.

Key Features:
TestNG for test execution and reporting
Page Object Model (POM) for better maintainability
Data-Driven Testing using Excel or CSV
Allure Reports for detailed visual reports
Selenium WebDriver for cross-browser testing
JUnit for assertions and running tests (optional)
Configuration files for different environments (optional)
Test Framework Architecture

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

Java JDK 8+
Maven (dependency management)
IntelliJ IDEA (IDE)
Allure Commandline (for generating reports)

How to Run Tests
Run from IntelliJ:
Right-click on the Test class or TestNG.xml file and select Run.
Run from Command Line:
bash

mvn test
Allure Reports
After running the tests, generate the Allure report by using the following command:

bash

allure serve target/allure-results
